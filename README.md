# Auto-WaterWorks
An Automated plant watering system that automatically waters a plant based on soil moisture values measured. 

This project covers a variety of things. Using an Arduino Grove Board, there are two sensors, one going directly to the plant as a Soil Sensor, and the other going to a MOSFET. Based on pre-determined moisture thresholds programmed in MATLAB, these signals are directly sent over from the soil sensor, and the pump delivers the water to the plant.
